  title    = "Fast Prediction of {DNA} Melting Bubbles Using {DNA}
              Thermodynamic Stability",
  author   = "Zrimec, Jan and Lapanje, Ales",
  abstract = "DNA melting bubbles are the basis of many DNA-protein
              interactions, such as those in regulatory DNA regions driving
              gene expression, DNA replication and bacterial horizontal gene
              transfer. Bubble formation is affected by DNA duplex stability
              and thermally induced duplex destabilization (TIDD). Although
              prediction of duplex stability with the nearest neighbor (NN)
              method is much faster than prediction of TIDD with the
              Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois (PBD) model, PBD predicted TIDD defines
              regulatory DNA regions with higher accuracy and detail. Here, we
              considered that PBD predicted TIDD is inherently related to the
              intrinsic duplex stabilities of destabilization regions. We show
              by regression modeling that NN duplex stabilities can be used to
              predict TIDD almost as accurately as is predicted with PBD.
              Predicted TIDD is in fact ascribed to non-linear transformation
              of NN duplex stabilities in destabilization regions as well as
              effects of neighboring regions relative to destabilization size.
              Since the prediction time of our models is over six orders of
              magnitude shorter than that of PBD, the models present an
              accessible tool for researchers. TIDD can be predicted on our

              TFs, our ability to quantitatively predict TF binding to
              different regulatory sequences is still limited. Here, we present
              a novel experimental assay termed BunDLE-seq that provides
              quantitative measurements of TF binding to thousands of fully
              designed sequences of 200 bp in length within a single
              experiment. Applying this binding assay to two yeast TFs, we
              demonstrate that sequences outside the core TF binding site
              profoundly affect TF binding. We show that TF-specific models
              based on the sequence or DNA shape of the regions flanking the
              core binding site are highly predictive of the measured
              differential TF binding. We further characterize the dependence
              of TF binding, accounting for measurements of single and
              co-occurring binding events, on the number and location of
              binding sites and on the TF concentration. Finally, by coupling
              our in vitro TF binding measurements, and another application of
              our method probing nucleosome formation, to in vivo expression
              measurements carried out with the same template sequences serving

              determine the different expression outcomes observed. Our assay
              thus paves the way to a more comprehensive understanding of TF

              Linear heteroduplex substrates containing double-stranded DNA
              binding sites for plasmid R1 relaxosome proteins and various
              regions of open duplex for TraI helicase loading were constructed
              to model putative intermediate structures in the initiation
              pathway. The activity of TraI was compared in steady-state
              multiple turnover experiments that measured the net production of
              unwound DNA as well as transesterase-catalyzed cleavage at nic.
              Helicase efficiency was enhanced by the relaxosome components
              TraM and integration host factor. The magnitude of stimulation
              depended on the proximity of the specific protein binding sites
              to the position of open DNA. The cytoplasmic domain of the R1
              coupling protein, TraDDeltaN130, stimulated helicase efficiency
              on all substrates in a manner consistent with cooperative
              interaction and sequence-independent DNA binding. Variation in

              regulatory effects of this protein on catalytic activities
              exhibited by the relaxosome during transfer initiation were

              Formation of the IR(2) cruciform and recognition of the distal

  abstract  = "Supervised learning methods have been successfully used to build
               classifiers for the identification of promoter regions. The
               classifier is often built from a dataset that has examples of
               promoter (positive) and non-promoter (negative) regions. Thus, a
               careful selection of the data used for constructing and
               evaluating a promoter finding algorithm is a very important
               issue. In this context, experimentally known promoter regions
               can be safely assumed to be positive training instances. In
               contrast, since definite knowledge whether a given region
               represents a non-promoter is not generally available, negative
               instances are not straightforward to be obtained. To make the
               problem more complex, for the case of promoter, there is not a
               unique definition of what a negative instance is. As a
               consequence, depending on which definition of non-promoter
               region one assumed to build the data, such a choice could affect
               significantly the performance of the classifier and/or yield a
               biased estimate of the performance. We present an empirical
               study of the effect of this kind of problem for promoter
               prediction in E. coli. As far as we are concerned, up to now,
               there is no such a kind of study for the context of prokaryotic

              how DNA bending rigidity (or persistence length, a) depends on
              its sequence. We addressed this problem using the method based on
              cyclization of short DNA fragments, which allows very accurate
              determination of a. Our approach was based on assigning specific
              values of a to each of 10 distinct dinucleotide steps. We
              prepared DNA fragments, each about 200 bp in length, with various

              (j factors), and fitted the data by the theoretical equation to
              obtain the values of a for each fragment. From these data, we

              DNA strand at its specific origin of transfer (oriT) binding
              site, sbi, and cleaves at a site called nic. In vitro studies
              suggest TraI is recruited to sbi by its accessory proteins, TraY

              combining experiments and theory. A new experimental method
              allows us to make a mapping of the opening of the guanines along
              the sequence as a function of temperature. The results indicate
              that non-local effects may be important in DNA because an AT-rich
              region is able to influence the opening of a base pair which is
              about 10 base pairs away. An earlier mesoscopic model of DNA is
              modified to correctly describe the timescales associated with the
              opening of individual base pairs well below melting, and to
              properly take into account the sequence. Using this model to

              to depend on two types of mechanism: one that involves the

              major groove, and one involving sequence-dependent deformations
              of the DNA helix. By comprehensively analysing the
              three-dimensional structures of protein--DNA complexes, here we

              appears to be determined by certain sequence-dependent
              modulations of DNA structure. To establish the detailed nature of
              these interactions, we have analysed the sequences of 177
              different DNA molecules from chicken erythrocyte core particles.
              All variations in the sequence content of these molecules, which
              may be attributed to sequence-dependent preferences for DNA
              bending, correlate well with the detailed path of the DNA as it
              wraps around the histone octamer in the crystal structure of the
              nucleosome core. The sequence-dependent preferences that
              correlate most closely with the rotational orientation of the
              DNA, relative to the surface of the protein, are of two kinds:
              ApApA/TpTpT and ApApT/ApTpT, the minor grooves of which face
              predominantly in towards the protein; and also GpGpC/GpCpC and
              ApGpC/GpCpT, whose minor grooves face outward. Fourier analysis
              has been used to obtain fractional variations in occurrence for
              all ten dinucleotide and all 32 trinucleotide arrangements. These
              sequence preferences should apply generally to many other cases
              of protein-DNA recognition, where the DNA wraps around a protein.
              In addition, it is observed that long runs of homopolymer (dA) X
              (dT) prefer to occupy the ends of core DNA, five to six turns
              away from the dyad. These same sequences are apparently excluded
              from the near-centre of core DNA, two to three turns from the
              dyad. Hence, the translational positioning of any single histone
              octamer along a DNA molecule of defined sequence may be strongly
              influenced by the placement of (dA) X (dT) sequences. It may also
              be influenced by any aversion of the protein for sequences in the
              ``linker'' region, the sequence content of which remains to be
              determined.",

              One can also calculate the amount of information (R frequency)
              that would be required to locate the sites, given that they occur
              with some frequency in the genome. Several Escherichia coli

              various external conditions. While B-form remains predominant
              under normal physiological conditions for most of the DNA
              sequences, low humidity and increased ion concentration cause B-
              to A-form transition. Certain proteins and molecules also
              sometimes cause local deformation of the DNA to the specific
              A-form. Previous experimental and computational studies focused
              on the overall B- to A-form transition. Here for the first time
              we investigated thermodynamics and mechanism of B- to A-form
              transition in water for various DNA sequences at a local
              dinucleotide base pair level. We introduced a new reaction
              coordinate Zp', based on the unique order parameter Zp, to drive
              B- to A-form transition locally and thereby calculate free energy
              profiles for the same for all the ten different dinucleotide
              steps embedded in a twelve base pair DNA. Results show that the
              trend of ``A'' and ``B'' philicity observed in experiment is
              preserved even at this local dinucleotide level, indicating its
              localized origin. Higher free energy cost obtained here is
              attributed to the cost of creating B∕A junctions along with
              formation of B->A transition at dimer level. We find that while
              water energetically stabilizes A-form for all the ten different
              dinucleotide steps to various extents, entropy acts against it.
              Therefore, we find that the stability of B-form DNA in water is

              conformational maps for all step types. For some steps, the maps
              agree well with experimental data from X-ray crystal structures,
              but other steps appear to be strongly perturbed by the effects of
              context (conformational coupling with the neighbouring steps).
              The optimised values of twist and roll show sequence-dependent
              variations consistent with the crystal structure data. The
              conformational maps allow us to construct adiabatic paths, and
              hence calculate the flexibility of each step with respect to
              slide and shift. Again the results agree well with the available
              experimental assignments of flexibility: YR steps, CA/TG and CG,
              are the most flexible and RR steps, such as AA, the least
              flexible.",

              factors and RNA polymerase to initiate transcription and contains
              short stretches of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), as

  title    = "Multiple plasmid origin-of-transfer substrates enable the spread
              of natural antimicrobial resistance to human pathogens",
  author   = "Zrimec, Jan",
  abstract = "Antimicrobial resistance poses a great danger to humanity, in
              part due to the widespread horizontal transfer of plasmids via
              conjugation. Modeling of plasmid transfer is essential to
              uncovering the fundamentals of resistance transfer and for
              development of predictive measures to limit the spread of
              resistance. However, a major limitation in the current
              understanding of plasmids is the inadequate characterization of
              the DNA transfer mechanisms, which conceals the actual potential
              for plasmid transfer in nature. Here, we consider that the
              plasmid-borne origin-of-transfer substrates encode specific DNA
              structural properties that can facilitate finding these regions
              in large datasets, and develop a DNA structure-based alignment
              procedure for typing the transfer substrates. Since our method
              outperforms current sequence-based approaches, we identify
              thousands of yet undiscovered DNA transfer substrates, showing
              that plasmid mobility is in fact 2-fold higher and spans almost
              2-fold more host species than is currently known. Over half of
              all mobile plasmids contain the means to transfer between
              different mobility groups, which links previously confined host
              ranges across ecological habitats into a vast network of
              potential plasmid transfers. Certain types of conjugative
              transfer mechanisms and their corresponding hosts are transfer
              hubs that help break down the horizontal gene transfer barriers
              and form a robust gene flow system. We show that this network in
              fact serves to transfer resistance from the environmental genetic
              reservoirs to human MDR pathogens, which is an important driver
              of the observed rapid resistance development in humans and thus
              an important point of focus for future prevention measures.
