Figure. Schematic depiction of the (A) construction and (B) usage of structural representations. In a structural representation of a given DNA sequence, each central nucleotide position and its neighboring regions define a k-mer from 3 to 9 bp in length, and are encoded as an s-mer with n structural dimensions (S. dim.) that can be defined as a sequence of s-mer cluster centroids.
